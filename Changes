Revision history for Perl extension Archive-Zip

1.30 Tue 30 Jun 2009 - Adam Kennedy
	- Fixed a bad use of Cwd::getcwd

1.29 Mon 29 Jun 2009 - Adam Kennedy
	- Changed _asLocalName back to rel2abs, but this time using
	  Cwd::getcwd as the base path instead of Cwd::cwd.
	  This hopefully resolved #47223 (ADAMK)

1.28 Tue 16 Jun 2009 - Adam Kennedy
	- Changing to production version for release
	- Reverted to revision 4736 and converted `External File Attribute'
	  values for symbolic links to hexadecimal (HAGGAI)
	- Fixed: #15026: AddTree does not include files with german
	  umlauts in the filename (HAGGAI)
	- Switched from Compress::Zlib to Compress::Raw::Zlib (AGRUNDMA)
	- Moved crc32 from bin to script (ADAMK)

1.27_01 Tue 16 Dec 2008 - Adam Kennedy
	- Makefile.PL will create a better META.yml
	- This is a test release for various improvements provided by
	  Alan Haggai. The entire release is credited to his grant work.
	- Fixed #25726: extractMembers failing across fork on Windows.
	- Fixed #12493: Can't add new files to archives which contain
	  files named 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 with no extension.
	  (Files named "0" are not archived)
	- Fixed #22933: Properly extract symbolic links.
	- Fixed #20246: Ability to assign a compression level to addTree
	  calls.
	- Corrected regular expression for stripping trailing /
	- Corrected addFileOrDirectory() behaviour and cleaned up some code
	- Added symbolic link support to addFileOrDirectory
	- Fixed #34657: No option, undefined behavior zipping symbolic
	  links (symlinks)
	- Added storeSymbolicLink()
	- Fixed bitFlag() to set General Pupose Bit Flags

1.26 Mon 13 Oct 2008 - Adam Kennedy
	- Fixed the dreaded but #24036: WinXP Explorer Exposes Problems.
	  This caused directories to appear as files in Windows Explorer
	  and was caused by Windows always reading the msdos directory bit
	  even when the file attributes are types as unix.
	  Resolved by emulating the behaviour of Info-Zip and setting
	  the 5th bit in the externalFileAttributes field.

1.25 Sat 11 Oct 2008 - Adam Kennedy
	- Removing "use warnings" instances that somehow slipped in
	- Skip test if Digest::MD5 is not available

1.24 Sun 23 Aug 2008 - Adam Kennedy
	- Blatantly pander to CPANTS by adding use strict to a deprecated module
	- Add an explicit load of FileHandle since in some circumstances,
	  calling GLOB->print() failed.
	- Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=25925 :
	- Archive-Zip wrote faulty .zip files when $\ was set (such as when running
	  using perl -l).
	- Incorporated a heavily modified version of ECARROLL's test file.
	- Thanks for ECARROLL for reporting it, and helping with the investigation.
	- The fix was to convert all $fh->print(@data) to $self->_print($fh, @data)
	  where the _print() method localizes $\ to undef.
	- Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14132 :
	- Incorrect file permissions after extraction.
	- Archive-Zip did not set the file permissions correctly in
	  extractToFileNamed(). 
	- Added t/10_chmod.t and t/data/chmod.zip. Changed 
	  lib/Archive/Zip/Member.pm.
	- Reported by ak2 and jlv (Thanks!)
	- SHLOMIF wrote the test script.
	- (SHLOMIF)
	- Removed a double "required module" from the Archive::Zip POD.
	- Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24557 ("documentation 
	  improvement"):
	- mentioned Archive::Zip::MemberRead in a few places.
	- TODO: 
		- 1. Add a method to Archive::Zip to get a ::MemberRead from an
		  archive member using -> notation. (?)
		- 2. In the POD of ::MemberRead - replace the indirect object
		  call.
		- Changed the POD of ::MemberRead:
		- replaced the indirect object construction with $PKG->new().
		- Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=34103 :
		- changed the example to read unless ( .. == AZ_OK) instead of
		  unless ( != AZ_OK), which was incorrect.

1.23 Thu  8 Nov 2007 - Adam Kennedy
	- Temporarily skilling some failing tests on Win32 in the
	  interests of toolchain sanity. (until we work out the
	  real problem here)

1.22 Fri  2 Nov 2007 - Adam Kennedy
	- Fixing platform compatibility bugs in the new regression tests
	  from 1.21.

1.21 Thu  1 Nov 2007 - Adam Kennedy
	- Tidying up copyright formatting a bit.
	- Disable the GPBF_HAS_DATA_DESCRIPTOR_MASK bit when auto-switching
	  directory storage to STORED because of a WinZip workaround because
	  the read code in Java JAR which was... ok, I really don't understand,
	  but Roland from Verisign says this one extra line unbreaks JAR files,
	  so I just applied it :)
	- fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=27463 with a
	  regression test - cannot add files whose entire filenames are "0". 
	  (SHLOMIF).
	- fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=26384 with a 
	  regression test - Archive::Zip::MemberRead::getline ignores 
	  $INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR . The modified file in the bug had it to be
	  reworked a bit and tests were added in the file
	  08_readmember_record_sep.t. 
	- Thanks to kovesp [...] sympatico.ca 
	- (SHLOMIF)

1.20 Tue  5 Jun 2007 - Adam Kennedy
	- Removing dependency on File::Which due to public outburst of flaming
	  on cpanra(n)tings by H.Merijn Brand. Try a simple email next time. :(
	- Embedding an entire copy of File::Which inside the tests instead as
	  an alternative to compensating for the lack of build_requires.
	- Removing the docs directory.
	  It only had out of date files and non-free copyrighted materials.
	  The tarball was probably illegal to distribute as a result.
	  (reported by Debian devs)

1.19 Internal use, public release skipped

1.18 Wed 25 Oct 2006 - Adam Kennedy
	- Changing to a production version for final release
	- No other changes of any kind

1.17_05 Tue 19 Sep 2006 - Adam Kennedy
	- Seperated the classes from the main file into seperate packages.
	- Merged the Zip.pod into the main Zip.pm file.
	- Applied default Perl::Tidy to all of the source files, to improve
	  the readability and maintainability of the files.
	- Added license in Makefile.PL
	- Added some additional entries to the realclean files

1.17_03 Sat 16 Sep 2006 - Adam Kennedy
	- Adding dependency on File::Which to deal with problems on systems
	  that lack zip and unzip programs. This really should be a build-time
	  dependency only, but ExtUtils::MakeMaker lacks that capability.
	- Builds and tests cleanly on Win32 now.

1.17_02 Sun  7 May 2006 - Adam Kennedy
	- Renamed the test scripts to the more conventional 01_name.t style
	- Upgraded all test scripts from Test.pm to Test::More (removing Test.pm dependency)
	- Various other miscellaneous cleanups of the test scripts
	- Removed MANIFEST and pod.t from repository (will be auto-generated)
	- Some cleaning up of the POD documentation for readability
	- Added SUPPORT section to docs
	- Merged external TODO file into the POD as a more-common TO DO section
	- Added a BUGS section to the docs

1.17_01 Sun 30 Apr 2006 - Adam Kennedy
	- Imported Archive::Zip into http://svn.ali.as/cpan/ orphanage.
	  If you have a CPAN login and have released a module, ask ADAMK about an
	  account and you can repair your bug directly in the repository.
	- Removed the revision comments from the old CVS repository
	- DOS DateTime Format doesn't support dates before 1980 and goes crazy when
	  decoding back to unix time. If we don't get passed a time at all
	  (0 or undef) we now throw an error.
	- DOS DateTime Format doesn't support dates before 1980, so if we find any
	  we warn and use Jan 1 12:01pm 1980 if we encounter any
	- Win32 doesn't support directory modification times.
	  Tentatively use the current time as the mod-time to prevent sending
	  null times to the unix2dos converter (and the resulting error)
	- Reformat the expected empty zip warning in the output to add a note that
	  the warning is entirely normal. Would be nice if some time later we can
	  suppress it altogether, but I don't have the cross-platform STDERR-fu
	  without adding a dependency to IPC::Run3 (which would be bad).
	- Adding a proper $VERSION to all classes, and synchronising them to the
	  same value.
	- Adding a BEGIN block around the require 5.003_96 so it works at
	  compile-time instead of post-compile.
	- Moved crc32 to bin/crc32 in line with package layout conventions

1.16 Mon Jul 04 12:49:30 CDT 2005
	- Grrrr...removed test that fails when installing under CPANPLUS.

1.15 Wed Jun 22 10:24:25 CDT 2005
	- added fix for RT #12771 Minor nit: warning in Archive::Zip::DirectoryMember::contents() 
	- added fix for RT #13327 Formatting problem in Archive::Zip::Tree manpage

1.15_02 Sat Mar 12 09:16:30 CST 2005 
	- fixed dates in previous entry!
	- began the process of migrating from the monolithic t/test.t to 
	  smaller scripts using Test::More.
	- started work on improving Archive::Zip's test coverage.  Coverage
	  is now up to just over 80%.
	- added error handling to writeToFileHandle
	- fixed small bug in extractMember from previous version
	  
1.15_01 Wed Mar  9 22:26:52 CST 2005
