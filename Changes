    - Unixified line endings in t/23_closed_handle.t
    - Added documentation for Archive::Zip::Member::isSymbolicLink,
      RT #130524
    - Implemented other, unrelated doc fixes
    - Fixed examples/zipcheck.pl to skip symbolic links, RT #130525
    - Described version 1.59, RT #117371 (tagged important!)

1.67 Sun 06 Oct 2019
    - Fixed compatibility issues with zip64 format (defined-or, pack)
    - Fixed hard-coded version fields introduced in version 1.66
    - Fixed merge glitch with tests 26 and 27
    - Fixed merge glitch with bzip passthrough
    - Updated bzip test file to avoid zip bomb detection

1.66 Mon 16 Sep 2019
    - Refactored low-level methods for reading and writing zip files
      in zip64 format.  Added new parameters and return values to
      most of these.  Extended constants in Archive::Zip to cover
      zip64 formats and lengths.
    - Added public APIs
        Archive::Zip::Archive::zip64
        Archive::Zip::Archive::desiredZip64Mode
        Archive::Zip::Archive::versionMadeBy
        Archive::Zip::Archive::versionNeededToExtract
        Archive::Zip::Member::zip64
        Archive::Zip::Member::desiredZip64Mode
      and constants
        Archive::Zip::ZIP64_AS_NEEDED
        Archive::Zip::ZIP64_EOCD
        Archive::Zip::ZIP64_HEADERS
      plus POD on these.
    - Added tests for zip64 format in t/21_zip64.t and more test zip
      files below t/data.  Extended tests in t/02_main.t to perform
      all existing tests in all possible desired zip64 modes.
    - Extended methods
        Archive::Zip::Member::localExtraField
        Archive::Zip::Member::cdExtraField
      to perform format checks when called as setters and to reject
      any zip64 extended information extra fields passed by the user.
      Extended POD and tests in t/02_main.t accordingly.
    - Setting {'compressedSize'} after writing central directory
      header.
    - Added new optional parameter $noFormatError to method
      Archive::Zip::_readSignature to silence any format errros when
      testing for signatures.
    - Added error handling for potentially failed object conversion
      after calling method Archive::Zip::Member::_become.  Factored
      in method Archive::Zip::Member::_becomeDirectoryIfNecessary
      into caller.
    - Changed methods
        Archive::Zip::Archive::contents
        Archive::Zip::Member::contents
      (and all inheriting from these) to consistently return a pair
      ($contents, $status) when called in list context and a scalar
      $contents when called in scalar context.  Extended tests in
      t/02_main.t accordingly.
    - Changed method Archive::Zip::Member::extractToFileHandle to
      accept a file name instead of a file handle when extracting
      symbolic links.  Changed lower-level and higher-level methods
      to use that feature.  Cleaned up code related to the handling
      of symbolic links.  Added creation of intermediate directories
      in method Archive::Zip::Member::extractToFileNamed for symbolic
      links as well.  Reporting errors from symlink call as AZ-error.
      Added POD and test zip file t/data/symlink.zip and tests in
      t/26_symlinks.t for these changes.
    - Cleaned up code and added comment related to that highly
      dubious (?) {'wasWritten'} logic.

    - More fixes by HAGGAI, which he still doesn't detail in Changes

1.31_01 Fri  5 Mar 2010 - Adam Kennedy
    - Various fixes by HAGGAI, which he has not yet provided details on:
    - Experimental Unicode in file/dir names

1.30 Tue 30 Jun 2009 - Adam Kennedy
    - Fixed a bad use of Cwd::getcwd

1.29 Mon 29 Jun 2009 - Adam Kennedy
    - Changed _asLocalName back to rel2abs, but this time using
      Cwd::getcwd as the base path instead of Cwd::cwd.
      This hopefully resolved #47223 (ADAMK)

1.28 Tue 16 Jun 2009 - Adam Kennedy
    - Changing to production version for release
    - Reverted to revision 4736 and converted `External File Attribute'

    - Moved crc32 from bin to script (ADAMK)

1.27_01 Tue 16 Dec 2008 - Adam Kennedy
    - Makefile.PL will create a better META.yml
    - This is a test release for various improvements provided by
      Alan Haggai. The entire release is credited to his grant work.
    - Fixed #25726: extractMembers failing across fork on Windows.
    - Fixed #12493: Can't add new files to archives which contain
      files named 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 with no extension.
      (Files named "0" are not archived)
    - Fixed #22933: Properly extract symbolic links.
    - Fixed #20246: Ability to assign a compression level to addTree
      calls.

    - Fixed bitFlag() to set General Pupose Bit Flags

1.26 Mon 13 Oct 2008 - Adam Kennedy
    - Fixed the dreaded but #24036: WinXP Explorer Exposes Problems.
      This caused directories to appear as files in Windows Explorer
      and was caused by Windows always reading the msdos directory bit
      even when the file attributes are types as unix.
      Resolved by emulating the behaviour of Info-Zip and setting
      the 5th bit in the externalFileAttributes field.

1.25 Sat 11 Oct 2008 - Adam Kennedy
    - Removing "use warnings" instances that somehow slipped in
    - Skip test if Digest::MD5 is not available

1.24 Sun 23 Aug 2008 - Adam Kennedy
    - Blatantly pander to CPANTS by adding use strict to a deprecated module
    - Add an explicit load of FileHandle since in some circumstances,
      calling GLOB->print() failed.
    - Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=25925 :
    - Archive-Zip wrote faulty .zip files when $\ was set (such as when running
      using perl -l).
    - Incorporated a heavily modified version of ECARROLL's test file.
    - Thanks for ECARROLL for reporting it, and helping with the investigation.
    - The fix was to convert all $fh->print(@data) to $self->_print($fh, @data)
      where the _print() method localizes $\ to undef.
    - Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14132 :
    - Incorrect file permissions after extraction.
    - Archive-Zip did not set the file permissions correctly in
      extractToFileNamed().
    - Added t/10_chmod.t and t/data/chmod.zip. Changed
      lib/Archive/Zip/Member.pm.
    - Reported by ak2 and jlv (Thanks!)
    - SHLOMIF wrote the test script.
    - (SHLOMIF)
    - Removed a double "required module" from the Archive::Zip POD.
    - Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24557 ("documentation
      improvement"):
    - mentioned Archive::Zip::MemberRead in a few places.
    - TODO:
        - 1. Add a method to Archive::Zip to get a ::MemberRead from an
          archive member using -> notation. (?)
        - 2. In the POD of ::MemberRead - replace the indirect object
          call.
        - Changed the POD of ::MemberRead:
        - replaced the indirect object construction with $PKG->new().
        - Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=34103 :
        - changed the example to read unless ( .. == AZ_OK) instead of
          unless ( != AZ_OK), which was incorrect.

1.23 Thu  8 Nov 2007 - Adam Kennedy
    - Temporarily skilling some failing tests on Win32 in the
      interests of toolchain sanity. (until we work out the
      real problem here)

1.22 Fri  2 Nov 2007 - Adam Kennedy
    - Fixing platform compatibility bugs in the new regression tests
      from 1.21.

1.21 Thu  1 Nov 2007 - Adam Kennedy
    - Tidying up copyright formatting a bit.
    - Disable the GPBF_HAS_DATA_DESCRIPTOR_MASK bit when auto-switching
      directory storage to STORED because of a WinZip workaround because
      the read code in Java JAR which was... ok, I really don't understand,
      but Roland from Verisign says this one extra line unbreaks JAR files,
      so I just applied it :)
    - fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=27463 with a
      regression test - cannot add files whose entire filenames are "0".
      (SHLOMIF).
    - fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=26384 with a
      regression test - Archive::Zip::MemberRead::getline ignores
      $INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR . The modified file in the bug had it to be
      reworked a bit and tests were added in the file
      08_readmember_record_sep.t.
    - Thanks to kovesp [...] sympatico.ca
    - (SHLOMIF)

1.20 Tue  5 Jun 2007 - Adam Kennedy
    - Removing dependency on File::Which due to public outburst of flaming
      on cpanra(n)tings by H.Merijn Brand. Try a simple email next time. :(
    - Embedding an entire copy of File::Which inside the tests instead as
      an alternative to compensating for the lack of build_requires.
    - Removing the docs directory.
      It only had out of date files and non-free copyrighted materials.
      The tarball was probably illegal to distribute as a result.
      (reported by Debian devs)

1.19 Internal use, public release skipped

1.18 Wed 25 Oct 2006 - Adam Kennedy
    - Changing to a production version for final release
    - No other changes of any kind

1.17_05 Tue 19 Sep 2006 - Adam Kennedy
    - Seperated the classes from the main file into seperate packages.
    - Merged the Zip.pod into the main Zip.pm file.
    - Applied default Perl::Tidy to all of the source files, to improve
      the readability and maintainability of the files.
    - Added license in Makefile.PL
    - Added some additional entries to the realclean files

1.17_03 Sat 16 Sep 2006 - Adam Kennedy
    - Adding dependency on File::Which to deal with problems on systems
      that lack zip and unzip programs. This really should be a build-time
      dependency only, but ExtUtils::MakeMaker lacks that capability.
    - Builds and tests cleanly on Win32 now.

1.17_02 Sun  7 May 2006 - Adam Kennedy
    - Renamed the test scripts to the more conventional 01_name.t style
    - Upgraded all test scripts from Test.pm to Test::More (removing Test.pm dependency)
    - Various other miscellaneous cleanups of the test scripts
    - Removed MANIFEST and pod.t from repository (will be auto-generated)
    - Some cleaning up of the POD documentation for readability
    - Added SUPPORT section to docs
    - Merged external TODO file into the POD as a more-common TO DO section
    - Added a BUGS section to the docs

1.17_01 Sun 30 Apr 2006 - Adam Kennedy
    - Imported Archive::Zip into http://svn.ali.as/cpan/ orphanage.
      If you have a CPAN login and have released a module, ask ADAMK about an
      account and you can repair your bug directly in the repository.
    - Removed the revision comments from the old CVS repository
    - DOS DateTime Format doesn't support dates before 1980 and goes crazy when
      decoding back to unix time. If we don't get passed a time at all
      (0 or undef) we now throw an error.
    - DOS DateTime Format doesn't support dates before 1980, so if we find any
      we warn and use Jan 1 12:01pm 1980 if we encounter any
    - Win32 doesn't support directory modification times.
      Tentatively use the current time as the mod-time to prevent sending
      null times to the unix2dos converter (and the resulting error)
    - Reformat the expected empty zip warning in the output to add a note that
      the warning is entirely normal. Would be nice if some time later we can
      suppress it altogether, but I don't have the cross-platform STDERR-fu
      without adding a dependency to IPC::Run3 (which would be bad).
    - Adding a proper $VERSION to all classes, and synchronising them to the
      same value.
    - Adding a BEGIN block around the require 5.003_96 so it works at
      compile-time instead of post-compile.
    - Moved crc32 to bin/crc32 in line with package layout conventions

1.16 Mon Jul 04 12:49:30 CDT 2005
    - Grrrr...removed test that fails when installing under CPANPLUS.
