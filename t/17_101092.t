# RT #101092: Creation of non-standard streamed zip file

# Test that reading a zip file that contains a streamed member, then writing
# it without modification will set the local header fields for crc, compressed
# length & uncompressed length all to zero.

# streamed.zip can be created with the following one-liner:
#
# perl -MIO::Compress::Zip=zip -e 'zip \"abc" => "streamed.zip", Name => "fred", Stream => 1, Method =>8'

my $infile = "t/data/streamed.zip";
my $outfile = OUTPUTZIP;

my $after = readFile($outfile);

my ($status, $reason) = testZip($outfile);

    or warn("ziptest said: $reason\n");
