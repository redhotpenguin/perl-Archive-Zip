# This test uses an archive, bzip.zip, that contains a member that uses bzip2 compression.
# The test is checking that the bzip2 member will pass-through to a new zip file without
# causing corruption.
# Before this fix  when you ran "unzip -t" on the newly created archive file it would report
# that the fip zipe was corrupted.
#
# See https://github.com/redhotpenguin/perl-Archive-Zip/issues/26 for more details.
